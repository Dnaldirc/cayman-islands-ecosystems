            <p> The preferred habitat for the blue iguana is rocky, sunlit, open areas in dry forests or near the shore, as the females must dig holes in the sand to lay eggs in June and July. A possible second clutch is laid in September. The blue iguana's herbivorous diet includes plants, fruits, and flowers. Its coloration is tan to gray with a bluish cast that is more pronounced during the breeding season and more so in males. It is large and heavy-bodied with a dorsal crest of short spines running from the base of the neck to the end of the tail.</p>

            <p> The Cayman Islands are a small group of low-lying Caribbean islands that serve as an important stop-over and wintering site for migratory land birds. A humid tropical climate provides for twenty-six species of herpetofauna, seventy-five percent of these are endemic to this ecoregion. Little of the original habitat remains. Introduced animals, such as domestic dogs and cats, and rats, pose the greatest threat to the native wildlife. The extinction of several endemic mammals are attributed to these invasive species.
